How many steps until I recover from a sudden lateral perturbation?

## Presentation
["N-step reachability to characterize human mediolateral stability during perturbed walking."](/assets/pdf/DW2019_patrickHolmes_poster_final.pdf) (**Patrick D. Holmes**, Xiao-Yu Fu, Shannon M. Danforth, Talia Y. Moore, Ram Vasudevan), in Dynamic Walking, 2019 (poster presentation).

## Music Video
A music video about walking stability we made before Rocketman came out for Dynamic Walking 2019. This video was also featured on IEEE Spectrum's [Video Friday.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/video-friday-agility-robotics-humanoid-robot-digit-stroll-downtown) (Thanks to Shannon M. Danforth and Talia Y. Moore.)
