## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan working in the Robotics and Optimization for Analysis of Human Motion (ROAHM) Lab. I'm interested in using control theoretic techniques to analyze human motion, as well as computer vision methods for extracting models of motion. My current research with Professor Ram Vasudevan focuses on quantifying stability during Sit-to-Stand.
