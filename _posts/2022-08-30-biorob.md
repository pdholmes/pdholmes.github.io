I had a great time attending BioRob 2022 in Seoul, Korea and presenting our paper ["Predicting Sagittal-Plane Swing Hip Kinematics in Response to Trips"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9799740) for lead author Shannon M. Danforth.
I was honored to accept the Best RA-L Paper Award on behalf of our team.
Thanks to Hyeju Yoo for the pictures!
